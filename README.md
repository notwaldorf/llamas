Box O'Facts
======

Only they're not actually facts. They're the top 10 Yahoo! answers about a thing. Like, but not limited to, llamas.

Featuring choice questions like "How do llamas eat their chestnuts without turning periwinkle?" and "How many llamas can the best llama wrangler wrangle in one hour?" (answer: "he'd wrangle all the llamas the best wrangler could wrangle, if the best wrangler wrangled in these wrangling conditions.").
